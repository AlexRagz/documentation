**Membership Pro** is a Joomla extension, so you need to have a website built on [Joomla CMS](http://joomla.org) to use the extension. Please look at [https://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html](https://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html) to see technial requirement for your server. Membership Pro only works with **Joomla 2.5** and **Joomla 3.x**, it doesn't work with **Joomla 1.5**.

Beside generic requirement with a Joomla website, **Membership Pro** also requires some additional requirements below:

1.  **PHP 5.3.x+**. Joomla 3.x requires PHP 5.3.10+ already, so if you are using Joomla 3, you won't have to worry about this requirement. However, if you are using Joomla 2.5, make sure your server is running PHP 5.3.x+ (on some Joomla 2.5 websites, we still see the server running PHP 5.2.17). If that's the case with your site, please contact your hosting provider, ask them to change settings for your hosting account to use Joomla 5.3.x+.
2.  If you use a credit card based payment plugin (for example, Paypal Pro, Authorize.net, Eway, NAB Transact...), customers will enter credit card information directly on your site for processing payment, so your site should **have an SSL certificate installed** so that the payment process will be secure. Without an SSL certificate, Membership Pro still works well, however, in this case, the credit card data which customers enter on your site for processing payment won't be encrypted when it is transfered over internet, and it will be inscure.
