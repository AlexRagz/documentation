Since custom fields are being displayed on subscriptions, you usually need to do the following tasks related to custom fields:
1. **Change title of the field**. In this case, just edit the custom field, change the title to meet your need and save it.
2. **Show / Hide** some of the existing custom fields on subscription form. In that case, just **Publish / Unpublish** the field you want.
2. **Make some fields become required / optional**. If so, just edit the custom field, set **Require** property to **Yes / No**.
3. **Add new custom fields**. In that case, just press New button in the toolbar to add new field.
4. **Change ordering of the custom fields**. In that case, just drag & drop the field to the postion you want (same with Joomla core)
