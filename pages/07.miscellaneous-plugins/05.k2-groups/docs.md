This plugin works in the same way with Joomla Groups plugin. The only difference is that it will assign subscribers of a subscription plan to selected **K2 Group** when subscription become active and remove them from the K2 Group when subscription is expired

This is useful if you use K2 extension on your site and want to give subscribers some special permission on K2

To use this plugin, go to Extensions -> Plugins, find and publish **OS Membership - K2 Groups plugin** plugin. Then edit the subscription plan, look at **K2 Groups Settings** tab, make necessary settings to get it works as you expected.
